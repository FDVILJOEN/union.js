Follow these easy steps to get union.js hooked up and building web content using only javascript:

## 1. Create a basic empty html file

The primary hook into the browser is still an html file, so we need a basic, empty file such as this:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>        
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```

## 2. Create a link to the union.js script

This is done using a script tag that either links to a local copy of union.js, or to the online version.  

```
<script src='https://fdviljoen.github.io/union.js/src/union.min.js'></script>
```
