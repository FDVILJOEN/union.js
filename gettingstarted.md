Follow these easy steps to get union.js hooked up and building web content using only javascript:

## 1. Create a basic empty html file

The primary hook into the browser is still an html file, so we need a basic, empty file such as this:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>        
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
