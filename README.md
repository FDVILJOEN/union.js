## union.js
### Simplified Web Development

Union.js moves then centre of web development away from the DOM, and into a Javascript object(s).

All html is emitted by union.js, and any programmatic changes to the javascript object gets reflected on the DOM. Changes made to the DOM or html page is also reflected back to your javascript objects.

Take a look at the hello world sample to see how it works.
