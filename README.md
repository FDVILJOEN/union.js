## union.js
..so that we can enjoy developing web content again.

Union.js is an attempt at moving the centre artefact of web development away from the DOM, and into a simple Javascript object.

The html DOM is then emitted and any scripting happens against the javascript object - which is then reflected in the DOM.

Take a look at the hello world sample to see how it works.
